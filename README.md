# Sales Forecasting Using Linear Regression
This project is about forecasting the sales of a retail company based on historical data using linear regression. The dataset used in this project is the "Big Mart Sales" dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about sales for 1559 products across 10 stores.

Dataset
The dataset is taken from kaggle and contains 180519 rows and 53 features.The link to the dataset is given below.

Dependencies
This project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Files
The project contains the following files:

DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv: The dataset used in the project
sales_forecasting.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
README.md: This file
Running the code
To run the code, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Once you have installed Jupyter, you can open the sales_forecasting.ipynb notebook and run the cells one by one.

Results
The Adaboost regressor model achieved an optimal RMSE on the test set.
